# CRT_Learning
Repo for CRT Genomic Data Science student led group learning 

One Directory per topic. Each participating student is encouraged upload a script (in whatever language) demonstrating what they personally learned about the topic along the way. 

When contributing a script we will try to follow a file naming convention in order to keep track of who submitted what. Lastname_Firstname.extension (?) 

Resources Directory will be used to collect Cheat Sheets and tutorials that people found relevant to their learning.
